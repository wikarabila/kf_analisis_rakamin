## Business Understanding

Kimia Farma, as the largest pharmaceutical company in Indonesia, operates through an extensive network of 1,725 branches spread across 70 cities in 31 provinces. From 2020 to 2023, Kimia Farma sold 150 types of pharmaceutical and health products. However, the company faces significant challenges, as indicated by fluctuating revenues during this period, with the highest revenue in 2022 amounting to Rp22,883,598,883 and the lowest in 2021 at Rp22,731,171,470.

**Current Problem**

  1. Revenue Fluctuations: Kimia Farma has experienced significant revenue fluctuations from 2020 to 2023, particularly with a noticeable decline in 2021.
  
  2. Economic Instability: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 led to a drastic revenue decline, followed by a partial recovery in 2022 and further fluctuations in 2023.
  
  3. Operational Inefficiencies in Certain Regions: While there are 10 provinces with the highest total transactions and net sales, there is still potential in other regions that have not been effectively optimized.

**Impact**

  1. Financial Impact: Revenue instability can affect the company’s cash flow, reinvestment capacity, and ability to maintain sustainable growth.
  2. Operational Impact: Revenue fluctuations may indicate operational inefficiencies, necessitating adjustments in distribution strategies, pricing, and inventory management.
  3. Strategic Impact: Without a deep understanding of the factors causing these fluctuations, the company may struggle to adjust its business strategies to address challenges and leverage market opportunities.
     
**Needs**

  1. In-depth Revenue and Sales Analysis: Understanding the factors causing revenue fluctuations and identifying specific periods of significant increases or decreases to improve sales strategies.
  2. Revenue Diversification Strategies: Developing more efficient and effective strategies to expand market share, particularly in provinces with high potential but suboptimal performance.
  3. Inventory Management Optimization: Better inventory management to avoid overstock or stockouts, especially in areas with high demand.

### Insight

- Revenue Fluctuations:
  - The year 2021 saw the largest revenue decline, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to mobility restrictions, disrupted supply chains, and reduced consumption levels. The year 2022 showed partial recovery, coinciding with post-pandemic economic improvement and more adaptive business strategies.

- Branch Performance by Province:
  - The ten provinces with the highest total transactions and net sales, such as West Java, North Sumatra, and Central Java, indicate that Kimia Farma’s business is concentrated in areas with dense populations and more developed healthcare infrastructure. This suggests opportunities for expansion into other regions with untapped demand.

- Economic Decline and Recovery:
  - The revenue decline in 2021 could be mitigated with more adaptive strategies, such as public health promotions, online sales, or adjusting product stock to match market demand. The higher revenue in 2022 suggests that the company began to recover but requires further strategies to maintain or increase these numbers in subsequent years.

- Focus on Branch Optimization:
  - Branches with high consumer ratings but low transaction ratings need further examination to understand why, despite positive consumer feedback, the transaction volume remains low. This may indicate issues at the service or product offering level.

## Conclusion

Based on the performance analysis of Kimia Farma's business from 2020 to 2023, several key findings have emerged:

- Revenue Fluctuations:
  - Kimia Farma's revenue experienced notable fluctuations over the period, with the highest revenue recorded in 2022 and the lowest in 2021. The decline in 2021 can likely be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused disruptions in supply chains, reduced consumer spending, and operational challenges. The recovery seen in 2022 suggests that the company adapted its strategies effectively to rebound from the economic downturn.

- Branch Performance and Regional Disparities:
  - The analysis identified 10 provinces, including West Java, North Sumatra, and Central Java, with the highest total transactions and net sales. This indicates that Kimia Farma's core market is concentrated in these populous regions. However, there are opportunities to expand and optimize operations in other regions that have not been fully leveraged.

- Operational Insights:
  - The analysis highlighted potential areas for operational improvement, particularly in branches with high customer satisfaction ratings but low transaction volumes. This discrepancy suggests the need to explore factors such as product availability, service efficiency, or localized marketing efforts.

- Strategic Recommendations:
  - To maintain and grow revenue, Kimia Farma should focus on optimizing inventory management, enhancing service quality in underperforming branches, and leveraging digital channels to reach a broader customer base. Additionally, targeted strategies to expand market presence in untapped regions could provide new growth opportunities.

By understanding these key insights, Kimia Farma can strengthen its business strategies, improve operational efficiency, and better position itself to achieve sustainable growth in the competitive pharmaceutical market.
